                <h2><div class="source image"></div>Hank the Cowdog: Murder in the Middle Pasture
                    <p>
                        <span>Hank</span> the Cowdog finds that there has been a murder on his ranch, so he sets off to investigate.
                        After a few adventures, Hank thinks the Coyote Brotherhood is responsible for the killing. He travels
                        to the Coyote Brotherhood, and demands to know who the murderer is. The coyotes just laugh and hold
                        Hank hostage, and plan to eat him by dawn; it is later revealed that the coyotes were not responsible
                        for the murder. Hank could have easily escaped had not Chief Guts ordered Rip and Snort, two stupid
                        coyote brothers, to make sure Hank does not run away. They keep him in a cave, guarding the exit.
                        Then Hank escapes (with the help of Missy Coyote) to his ranch. Once gets out he runs back to the
                        ranch to find the real murderers. Apparently the real murderers were a dog named Buster and a gang
                        of two dogs with a pug named Muggs as his assistant. Hank says mean things to the coyotes (Scraunch,
                        Rip and Snort) and Buster and his gang but makes them think that it was each other that was saying
                        mean things to them. The coyotes and the gang got into a fight and the coyotes won and chased the
                        gang off the ranch.

                    <h2>Hank the Cowdog: The Curse of the Incredible Priceless Corncob
                        <p>The story begins with a typically insane conversation between
                            <span>Hank</span> and his assistant Drover, which is interrupted by Sally May the ranch wife calling
                            them and Pete the barncat for the dinner scraps. Among the scraps are two corncobs, some steak
                            fat and a t-bone. Hank and Drover receive the corncobs, while Pete gets the more delectable scraps.
                            Pete, most probably in an attempt to confuse the two dogs and have some fun, attempts to "steal"
                            their corncobs. When caught, he suggests that they trade the corncobs and the meat. Hank reasons
                            that if Pete wants the corncobs so bad, they must be priceless, and he and Drover promptly take
                            the corncobs back to their gunnysacks beds, leaving Pete with all the meat. Their suddenly discovered
                            "wealth", however, soon makes the two dogs suspicious of each other.
